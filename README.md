# otp-scratch

This project is a scratch for experimenting with OTP (One-Time Password)
generation and validation using Bun and TypeScript with the `otpauth` library.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your machine.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/feyli/otp-scratch.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd otp-scratch
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```

## Usage

To run the service in the console, use the following command:

```bash
bun run start
```
OR
```bash
bun start
```

This will start the app in the terminal, where you can see OTP generation and validation in action.
